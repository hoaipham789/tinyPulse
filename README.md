I use Selenium Webdriver base on JAVA and TestNG framework </br>
Just run the TestSuite.xml file to start the test </br>
Edit the values of emailField1 (line 40) / emailField2 (line 43) in UserSetting class for re-run </br>
For the optional question: I have put 2 cases: </br>
1- Add user with email has been registered </br>
2- Verify Add more button </br>
